1.0 Introduction
This document outlines the treatment plan for risks deemed unacceptable following the risk assessment process. The plan details the selected treatment options, associated controls, responsible parties, and timelines for implementation.

The treatment of risk follows the following options:

Modify: Implement security controls to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of the risk.

Avoid: Discontinue the activity that gives rise to the risk.

Share: Transfer the risk to a third party (e.g., through insurance).

Retain: Accept the risk based on informed management decision.

2.0 Risk Treatment Plan
The following table details the treatment plan for high and medium risks identified in the risk assessment report (02-Risk-Assessment-Report.md).

3. Enhance email filtering rules to better detect and quarantine sophisticated phishing emails.	Head of IT Operations	Q1 2024
R-003
(High)	Modify	A.5.26.1 Information security event reporting
A.8.13.1 Information backup
A.8.16.1 Monitoring activities	1. Implement a formal and promoted procedure for employees to report security events.
2. Critical Action: Validate and test the restore procedure for critical servers from backups. Test to be conducted quarterly.
3. Fine-tune SIEM correlation rules to detect early indicators of ransomware activity (e.g., mass file encryption).	Head of IT Operations	Q1 2024
R-004
(Medium)	Modify	A.5.3.1 Segregation of duties
A.8.1.1 User access management
A.8.12.1 Data leakage prevention	1. Review and enforce SoD matrices in financial processing systems.
2. Conduct a semi-annual user access review for all privileged accounts and systems containing customer data.
3. Configure DLP policies to alert on and block large transfers of structured customer data to unauthorized endpoints.	Head of IAM	Q2 2024
R-005
(Medium)	Modify	A.9.1.1 Supplier relationships
A.9.2.1 Monitoring of supplier services
A.8.12.1 DLP	1. Integrate a security assessment questionnaire into the vendor procurement process.
2. Perform annual security reviews for critical vendors, requiring evidence of their compliance.
3. Apply DLP policies to data shared with third parties to prevent further unauthorized sharing.	Head of Procurement	Q3 2024
3.0 Justification for Selection & Exclusion
3.1 Justification for Selected Controls
R-001: A combination of proactive intelligence, preventative policy, and detective DLP controls provides a defense-in-depth approach to cloud security, addressing the shared responsibility model.

R-002: A multi-layered "People, Process, Technology" approach is chosen. Training reduces the likelihood, email filtering reduces the attack surface, and SoD reduces the impact if credentials are compromised.

R-003: Robust, tested backups are the single most effective control against ransomware. Monitoring and reporting enable early detection and response to minimize impact.

R-004: The principle of least privilege (access management) and segregation of duties are primary preventative controls against insider threats. DLP acts as a final detective and corrective control.

R-005: The primary lever for managing third-party risk is contractual and based on assurance activities (assessments, audits). DLP provides a technical control to protect the data itself.

3.2 Rationale for Exclusion of Controls
Certain controls were considered but excluded for valid business reasons:

Control A.8.11.1 (Data Masking): This control was considered for R-004 but was excluded for customer service representatives. They require access to full customer data to effectively resolve issues, verify identities, and provide service. Masking would impede their primary business function. The risk is instead treated by stricter access controls (A.8.1.1) and activity monitoring.

4.0 Residual Risk
Following the implementation of the above controls, each risk will be re-assessed to determine the residual risk level. This plan will be updated to reflect the new risk rating, and any residual risks that remain at a "High" level will be presented to management for formal acceptance.

5.0 Review
This Risk Treatment Plan is a living document. It will be reviewed and updated:

Annually, as part of the management review cycle.

Following the implementation of treatment actions.

In response to significant changes in the risk environment.
