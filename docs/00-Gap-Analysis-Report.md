# ISO 27001:2022 Gap Analysis Report

**Report ID:** GAP-2023-001
**Date Conducted:** 2023-09-10
**Lead Analyst:** Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
**Participants:** Head of IT, Head of Compliance, Head of HR, Head of Risk

## 1.0 Executive Summary
This report outlines the findings of a gap analysis conducted to assess SecureBank Finance's current information security practices against the requirements of the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard. The analysis identified several key strengths in existing technical controls but highlighted significant gaps in formalized documentation, systematic risk management, and operational processes. A total of 12 major gaps were identified, primarily within Clauses 4-10 of the standard. This report provides a prioritized action plan to address these gaps and achieve certification.

## 2.0 Methodology
The analysis was conducted through:
1.  **Documentation Review:** Examination of existing policies, procedures, and records.
2.  **Interviews:** Discussions with key personnel across IT, Compliance, HR, and business units.
3.  **Technical Assessment:** Review of security control configurations and tools in place.
4.  **Mapping:** Current practices were mapped to each clause and control of ISO 27001:2022.

## 3.0 Detailed Gap Analysis

### 3.1 Context of the Organization (Clause 4)
| Requirement | Status | Findings & Evidence | Gap Description | Severity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **4.2** Understanding needs of interested parties | ❌ Not Met | No structured process to identify or document requirements from customers, regulators, etc. | Interested parties and their requirements are not systematically identified or documented. | High |
| **4.3** Determining the scope | ❌ Not Met | No formal scope statement exists. | The boundaries and applicability of the ISMS have not been defined in a scope statement. | High |
| **4.4** Information security management system | ✅ Partial | Security activities are performed but are not integrated into a coherent management system. | Lack of a established, implemented, and maintained ISMS framework. | High |

### 3.2 Leadership (Clause 5)
| Requirement | Status | Findings & Evidence | Gap Description | Severity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **6.1.3** Information security risk treatment | ❌ Not Met | Controls are implemented ad-hoc, not based on a risk treatment plan. | No process for selecting, implementing, and evaluating controls to treat identified risks. | High |

## 4.0 Summary of Gaps by Severity

| Severity | Count | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High** | 8 | Fundamental absence of required processes or documentation. Directly prevents certification. |
| **Medium** | 3 | Process exists but is informal, inconsistent, or not fully documented. |
| **Low** | 1 | Minor documentation or process improvement needed. |

## 5.0 Strengths Identified
*   **Strong Technical Controls:** Existing investment in firewalls, EDR, and encryption provides a solid technical foundation (e.g., Annex A.8 controls are partially met).
*   **Regulatory Compliance Culture:** Existing processes for GDPR and PCI DSS compliance can be leveraged for the ISMS.
*   **Skilled Personnel:** IT and Security teams possess the necessary technical skills to implement the standard.

## 6.0 Recommended Action Plan

| Priority | Gap | Recommended Action | Owner | Target Date |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **4.3 ISMS Scope** | Develop and approve the ISMS Scope statement. | CISO | 2023-10-27 |
| **1** | **5.2 Information Security Policy** | Draft and gain leadership approval for the top-level policy. | CISO | 2023-10-27 |
| **1** | **6.1.2 Risk Assessment Process** | Define and document the risk assessment methodology. | CISO | 2023-11-15 |
| **2** | **4.2 Interested Parties** | Identify and document key parties and their requirements. | Head of Compliance | 2023-11-30 |
| **2** | **9.3 Management Review** | Schedule and conduct the first management review meeting. | CISO | 2023-12-15 |
| **3** | **7.2 Competence** | Formalize security training records and requirements. | Head of HR | 2024-Q1 |

## 7.0 Conclusion
SecureBank Finance has a strong baseline of technical security controls but lacks the formalized management system framework required by ISO 27001. The implementation project should prioritize establishing the foundational documentation (Scope, Policy, Risk Process) before refining specific controls. With dedicated resources, the identified gaps can be addressed within a 6-9 month timeframe to achieve certification readiness.
