Risk Assessment Report
Framework: ISO/IEC 27005:2022
Assessment Date: October 26, 2023
Assessment Lead: Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)

1.0 Methodology
SecureBank Finance employs a quantitative risk assessment methodology based on a 5x5 Risk Matrix. Risks are evaluated based on their Likelihood of occurrence and potential Impact on the organization.

Risk Level = Likelihood (L) x Impact (I)

Risk levels are categorized as follows:

1-6: Low

7-12: Medium

13-20: High

21-25: Very High

1.1 Impact Criteria
Impact is assessed on a scale of 1 (Negligible) to 5 (Catastrophic), considering the following criteria:

Score	Financial Loss	Reputational Damage	Regulatory Impact	Operational Disruption
1	< €50k	Minimal	None	Minor delay
2	€50k - €250k	Minor	Notice of violation	Single process affected
3	€250k - €1M	Significant	Fine (< €500k)	Department outage
4	€1M - €5M	Major	Fine (€500k - €2M)	Multiple departments affected
5	> €5M	Severe/Catastrophic	Major fine (> €2M)	Organization-wide outage
1.2 Likelihood Criteria
Likelihood is assessed on a scale of 1 (Rare) to 5 (Almost Certain), based on:

Score	Description	Criteria
1	Rare	Unlikely to occur in the next 2-5 years.
2	Unlikely	Could occur in the next 2-3 years.
3	Possible	Might occur once per year.
4	Likely	Might occur multiple times per year.
5	Almost Certain	Expected to occur multiple times per month.
1.3 Risk Acceptance Criteria
Low & Medium Risks: May be accepted with justification from the risk owner.

High & Very High Risks: Must be treated with security controls to reduce the risk level to an acceptable threshold.

2.0 Risk Assessment Process
The assessment followed the ISO 27005 process:

Risk Identification: Workshops with IT, Compliance, Legal, and Business Unit leaders to identify assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.

Risk Analysis: Assigning Likelihood and Impact scores based on the defined criteria.

Risk Evaluation: Comparing calculated risk levels against the acceptance criteria to determine which risks require treatment.

3.0 Sample Risk Assessment
The following table details a sample of key risks identified during the assessment.

Risk ID	Risk Scenario	Likelihood	Impact	Risk Level (LxI)
R-001	Customer Data Leak due to Cloud Service Provider (IaaS) misconfiguration.	3	5	15 (High)
R-002	Account Takeover via a successful phishing attack compromising employee credentials.	4	4	16 (High)
R-003	System Downtime due to a ransomware attack encrypting critical banking servers.	3	5	15 (High)
R-004	Data Breach caused by a malicious insider exfiltrating customer data.	2	5	10 (Medium)
R-005	Compliance Failure and regulatory penalty due to a third-party vendor's security lapse.	3	4	12 (Medium)
