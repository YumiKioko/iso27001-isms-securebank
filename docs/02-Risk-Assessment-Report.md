2. Risk Assessment (ISO 27005 Process)
Methodology: We use a 5x5 matrix based on Likelihood and Impact (1-5 scale).

Risk Assessment Steps
Risk Identification: Brainstorming sessions with IT, compliance, and business units.

Risk Analysis: Assigning Likelihood (L) and Impact (I) scores.

Impact Criteria: Financial loss, reputational damage, regulatory fines, operational disruption.

Likelihood Criteria: Based on historical data, threat intelligence, and expert judgment.

Risk Evaluation: Comparing risk levels against risk acceptance criteria. Risks rated "High" (15-25) or "Very High" (20-25) must be treated.

Sample Risk Assessment Table
Risk ID	Risk Scenario (Asset-Threat-Vulnerability)	Likelihood	Impact	Risk Level (LxI)
R-001	Customer Data Leak due to CSP misconfiguration (IaaS)	3	5	15 (High)
R-002	Account Takeover via successful phishing attack on employees	4	4	16 (High)
R-003	System Downtime due to ransomware encryption of critical servers	3	5	15 (High)
R-004	Data Breach caused by a malicious insider exfiltrating customer data	2	5	10 (Medium)
R-005	Compliance Failure due to a third-party vendor's security lapse	3	4
