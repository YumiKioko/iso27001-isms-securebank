**Description:** This is a visual representation of the 5x5 risk matrix used for the ISO 27005 risk assessment.

## Visual Description:
This image is a 5x5 grid. The Y-axis represents **Likelihood** (1-5: Rare to Almost Certain). The X-axis represents **Impact** (1-5: Negligible to Catastrophic). Each cell in the grid is color-coded:

*   **Green (Low Risk):** Cells with a score of 1-6.
*   **Yellow (Medium Risk):** Cells with a score of 7-12.
*   **Orange (High Risk):** Cells with a score of 13-20.
*   **Red (Very High Risk):** Cells with a score of 21-25.

The specific risks from the `03-Risk-Assessment-Report.md` (R-001, R-002, etc.) are plotted as dots on this grid to visualize their assessed inherent risk level.

## Purpose:
This diagram provides an at-a-glance view of the organization's risk profile and is a key artifact in the risk assessment process.
