# Nonconformity and Corrective Action Procedure

**Procedure ID:** PROC-CA-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Owner:** CISO

## 1.0 Purpose
To define the process for addressing nonconformities and implementing corrective actions to eliminate the causes of actual or potential nonconformities.

## 2.0 Scope
Applies to nonconformities related to the ISMS identified from any source (e.g., audits, incidents, complaints).

## 3.0 Procedure

### 3.1 Identifying and Reacting to Nonconformities
*   **Sources:** Nonconformities can be identified through internal audits, external audits, security incidents, management reviews, or employee reports.
*   **Initial Reaction:** Contain and correct the immediate issue (e.g., stop a process, correct a faulty record).

### 3.2 Evaluating the Need for Action
*   The CISO or designated owner shall evaluate if corrective action is needed to eliminate the cause(s) of the nonconformity, to prevent recurrence.

### 3.3 Determining the Causes
*   A root cause analysis (RCA) shall be performed for significant nonconformities. Methods may include the "5 Whys" or fishbone diagram.

### 3.4 Determining and Implementing Corrective Actions
*   **Action Plan:** Identify and plan actions to address the root cause.
*   **Effectiveness:** Actions must be appropriate to the effects of the nonconformities encountered.
*   **Implementation:** The assigned owner implements the planned actions within the agreed timeframe.

### 3.5 Reviewing the Effectiveness of Actions
*   The CISO reviews the effectiveness of the corrective action once implemented.
*   If the action is ineffective, the process is repeated.

### 3.6 Updating Risks and Opportunities
*   If necessary, the Risk Treatment Plan (`03-Risk-Treatment-Plan.md`) and Risk Assessment (`02-Risk-Assessment-Report.md`) are updated based on the findings from the corrective action.

### 3.7 Recording Information
*   The nature of the nonconformities and any subsequent actions taken are recorded in the Corrective Action Log (`records/corrective-action-log.csv`).
