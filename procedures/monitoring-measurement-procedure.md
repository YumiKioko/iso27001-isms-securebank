# Monitoring, Measurement, Analysis & Evaluation Procedure

**Procedure ID:** PROC-MON-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Owner:** CISO

## 1.0 Purpose
To ensure the organization can evaluate the information security performance and the effectiveness of the ISMS.

## 2.0 Scope
Applies to all processes and controls within the ISMS scope.

## 3.0 Procedure

### 3.1 What to Monitor and Measure
*   **Performance of Security Controls:** (e.g., AV detection rates, firewall block rates, failed login attempts).
*   **ISMS Effectiveness:** Achievement of information security objectives (see `07-Information-Security-Objectives.md`).
*   **Process Efficiency:** (e.g., time to grant/revoke access, time to patch critical systems).

### 3.2 Methods for Monitoring, Measurement, Analysis and Evaluation
*   **Automated Tools:** SIEM, vulnerability scanners, and other security tools provide continuous monitoring and generate reports.
*   **Manual Reviews:** Internal audits, management reviews, and access reviews provide periodic evaluation.
*   **KPIs and Metrics:** Defined metrics are tracked on a security dashboard reviewed by the CISO weekly.

### 3.3 When to Monitor and Measure
*   **Continuous:** Automated security monitoring (SIEM, IDS/IPS).
*   **Periodic:** Monthly KPI reviews, quarterly access reviews, annual internal audits.
*   **On-Demand:** Following a security incident or major change.

### 3.4 Evaluation and Analysis
*   The results of monitoring and measurement are analyzed to determine:
    *   The effectiveness of the ISMS.
    *   Opportunities for improvement.
    *   Trends in information security performance.
*   Findings are reported as input to management review.
