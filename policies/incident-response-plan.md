# Incident Response Plan

**Policy Identifier:** POL-IRP-004
**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** 2023-10-27
**Approval Authority:** Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
**Plan Owner:** Security Operations Center (SOC) Manager

## 1.0 Purpose
To establish a structured approach for responding to information security incidents. The goal is to minimize the impact of security incidents on SecureBank Finance's operations, customers, and reputation, and to comply with regulatory obligations for incident reporting.

## 2.0 Scope
This plan applies to all suspected or confirmed security incidents involving SecureBank Finance's information assets, networks, systems, and data.

## 3.0 Definition of an Incident
A security incident is any unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, destruction, or disruption of an information asset that has the potential to cause harm to the organization. Examples include:
*   A suspected malware or ransomware infection.
*   Unauthorized access to or exfiltration of customer data.
*   Denial-of-Service attack affecting online banking availability.
*   A successful phishing attack compromising user credentials.
*   Physical breach of a data center.

## 4.0 Incident Response Team (IRT)
**Core Team:**
*   **CISO:** Incident Director (ultimate decision-making authority)
*   **SOC Manager:** Incident Lead (technical lead for response)
*   **Head of IT Operations:** (Resource coordination for containment)
*   **Head of Corporate Communications:** (Manages public and customer messaging)
*   **Legal Counsel & Data Protection Officer (DPO):** (Manages regulatory and legal obligations)

## 5.0 Incident Response Phases

### 5.1 Preparation
*   This plan is maintained and tested via tabletop exercises biannually.
*   IRT members are identified and trained on their roles.
*   Technical tools (SIEM, EDR, forensics) are in place.

### 5.2 Detection & Analysis
1.  **Reporting:** All personnel must report suspected incidents immediately to the SOC via the 24/7 dedicated phone line or email (`soc@securebank.example`).
2.  **Triage:** The SOC will triage all reports to confirm if an incident has occurred.
3.  **Classification:** The incident is classified based on its severity (e.g., Critical, Major, Minor). A critical incident involves a breach of customer PII or a severe outage of a critical system.

### 5.3 Containment, Eradication & Recovery
1.  **Short-term Containment:** Immediate actions to limit damage (e.g., disconnecting an infected machine from the network, blocking malicious IPs).
2.  **Evidence Gathering:** The SOC will preserve forensic evidence for root cause analysis and potential legal action.
3.  **Eradication:** Remove the cause of the incident (e.g., delete malware, disable compromised accounts).
4.  **Recovery:** Restore systems to normal operation from clean backups. Validate that systems are functioning correctly and are no longer vulnerable.

### 5.4 Post-Incident Activity (Lessons Learned)
1.  **Blameless Post-Mortem:** Conduct a meeting with all involved parties to identify:
    *   What happened?
    *   How can we prevent it from happening again?
2.  **Root Cause Analysis:** Document the root cause of the incident.
3.  **Update Controls:** Implement corrective actions to address the root cause (logged in the Corrective Action Log).
4.  **Report:** For incidents involving customer data, prepare reports for management and relevant regulators (e.g., within 72 hours for GDPR) as advised by Legal Counsel and the DPO.

## 6.0 Communication Plan
*   **Internal:** Status updates will be provided to the Executive Team and key stakeholders at regular intervals during a critical incident.
*   **External:** All external communication (press, customers, regulators) must be coordinated exclusively by Corporate Communications and Legal Counsel.

## 7.0 Review
This plan shall be tested and reviewed at least annually.
