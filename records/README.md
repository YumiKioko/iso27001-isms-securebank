# Training Records Directory

This directory contains records of information security training, skills, experience, and qualifications.

**Important Notes:**
*   This directory is a placeholder for the *index* of training records.
*   **Actual training acknowledgments, certificates, and signed documents are stored in the organization's HRMS (e.g., Workday) and are not duplicated here for security and privacy reasons.**
*   The files in this directory (e.g., `security-awareness-training-2023-Q3.md`) serve as a summary and index, providing auditors with a clear map to the evidence stored in the primary system.
*   This process ensures a single source of truth for personnel data while still meeting the ISO 27001 requirement for retaining evidence of training.
