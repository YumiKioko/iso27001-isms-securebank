ISO 27001 Implementation for a Financial Institution (Example)
This repository contains a fictional, yet comprehensive, example of an ISO 27001:2022 implementation for "SecureBank Finance," a mid-sized financial institution offering retail banking, investment services, and online banking.

This example covers the full Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, a risk assessment following ISO 27005, and addresses common financial sector risks.

Disclaimer
This is an example for educational and illustrative purposes. It is not a substitute for professional consultation. The controls chosen are examples; a real implementation must be based on a thorough risk assessment tailored to the specific organization.

Core Risks Addressed
Phishing & Social Engineering Attacks leading to unauthorized access to customer accounts.

Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Compromise (e.g., IaaS/PaaS misconfiguration leading to data leakage).

Insider Threat (malicious or accidental data exfiltration by employees).

Third-Party Vendor Risk (e.g., a fintech partner with weak security causing a supply chain attack).

Ransomware Attack encrypting critical financial systems and customer data.

Repository Structure
The implementation is documented across several files in the /docs, /policies, and /procedures directories. Start with the ISMS-Scope document to understand the context.
